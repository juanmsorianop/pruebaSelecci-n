Run the broker in multiservice way, with the following configuration:

* Default queue size 3 and 2 workers
* service `serv1` queue size 1 and 2 workers
* service `serv2` queue size 2 and 2 workers

(Queue/pool sizes and HTTP timeout take absurd values for the sake of demostrability)

```
contextBroker -fg -httpTimeout 10000000 -logLevel INFO -multiservice -notificationMode threadpool:3:2,serv1:1:2,serv2:2:2
```

Run the accumulator server, as notification receptor.

```
accumulator-server.py --port 1028 --url /accumulate --host ::1 --pretty-print -v
```

We set up three subscriptions, for `serv1`, `serv2` and `serv3`. We use special URLs in the accumulator
that nerver get a response, in order to see the effect of a "blocked" worker.

```
curl -v localhost:1026/v2/subscriptions -s -S -H 'fiware-service: serv1' -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d @- <<EOF
{
  "description": "serv1 subscriptions",
  "subject": {
    "entities": [
      {
        "id": "E",
        "type": "T"
      }
    ]    
  },
  "notification": {
    "http": {
      "url": "http://localhost:1028/waitForever"
    }
  }
}
EOF

curl -v localhost:1026/v2/subscriptions -s -S -H 'fiware-service: serv2' -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d @- <<EOF
{
  "description": "serv2 subscriptions",
  "subject": {
    "entities": [
      {
        "id": "E",
        "type": "T"
      }
    ]    
  },
  "notification": {
    "http": {
      "url": "http://localhost:1028/waitForever"
    }
  }
}
EOF

curl -v localhost:1026/v2/subscriptions -s -S -H 'fiware-service: serv3' -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d @- <<EOF
{
  "description": "serv3 subscriptions",
  "subject": {
    "entities": [
      {
        "id": "E",
        "type": "T"
      }
    ]    
  },
  "notification": {
    "http": {
      "url": "http://localhost:1028/waitForever"
    }
  }
}
EOF
```

Now, let's stimulate the subscriptions to see how it works. Repeat 4 times the following request:

```
curl -v localhost:1026/v2/entities?options=upsert,forcedUpdate -s -S -H 'fiware-service: serv1' -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d @- <<EOF
{
  "id": "E",
  "type": "T",
  "A": {
     "value": 1,
	 "type": "Number"
  }
}
EOF
```

We will see in the logs something like this:`

```

The notifications triggered by the first and second requests are taken by the workers, that keep waiting for a response that never comes.
The third notification is put in queue, which gets full (as queue size is only one). Thus, the fourth notification is discarded
and we see `Runtime Error (serv1 notification queue is full)`.

But the good thing is that queue saturation is isolated to `serv1`. In `serv2` notifications are still working as expected.
Let's repeat the following request five times:

```
curl -v localhost:1026/v2/entities?options=upsert,forcedUpdate -s -S -H 'fiware-service: serv2' -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d @- <<EOF
{
  "id": "E",
  "type": "T",
  "A": {
     "value": 1,
	 "type": "Number"
  }
}
EOF
```

We will see something like this in the logs:

```

This time, first 2 notifications are for the workers, 2 next ones are stored in the queue (which size is 2). The fifth
one doesn't fit in the queue, so it's discarded and we see the `Runtime Error (serv2 notification queue is full)` error trace.

But the default queue (i.e. the queue used by services that doesn't have a dedicated queue) is still working. Let's repeat
the following request six times:

```
curl -v localhost:1026/v2/entities?options=upsert,forcedUpdate -s -S -H 'fiware-service: serv3' -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d @- <<EOF
{
  "id": "E",

  "A": {

  }
}
EOF
```
